/[Kks]/

/[bc][aou]t/i

/[0-9A-Ja-j]/

// also

/[0-9a-j]/i

// matches any LETTER that is not x or X

/[A-WYZa-wyz]/

// possibly /[a-wyz]/i also?

/[^a-z]/i

// /(ABC|abc)/ and  /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/ are not equivalent regex because
// the first regex will only match the exact pattern of a capital A,
// followed by a capital B, followed by a capital C or a lowercase a,
// followed by a lowercase b, followed by a lowercase c. The second
// regex could match a pattern where any of the letters are capitals
// or lowercase, in any of the positions, i.e. (aBc or abC)

// /abc/i and /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/ are equivalent as long as their patterns
// are not modified. I cannot think of a situation of a string that 
// would match one of these regex but not the other 

/\[\^[A-Za-z0-9]-[A-Za-z0-9]\]/

// alt solution

/[\[][\^][0-9A-Za-z]-[0-9A-Za-z][\]]/

// explanation for the second solution.

// [\[] uses a character class that looks for a literal [
// [\^] uses a character class that looks for a literal ^
// a character class that will look for characters between
// 0-9, A-Z and a-z followed by a literal hypen (this does
// not need to be escaped because it's not in a character
// class.)
// The same 0-9, A-Z and a-z expression that looks for the
// ending of a character class range and finally a literal
// ] represented by [\]]

// the regex string /[^+-<]/ is technically valid regex but such
// ranges are best avoidded and should be thought of as invalid.
